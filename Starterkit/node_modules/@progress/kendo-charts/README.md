## Development

### Running the examples

Inside the repo directory run `npm ci && npm start`. The demos will be available at `http://localhost:3000/`.

### Linking the kendo-drawing package

Due to the dependency of the package to [@progress/kendo-drawing](https://github.com/telerik/kendo-drawing), it's often necessary to make changes to both packages during development. The most convenient way to develop is using [npm link](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v8/commands/npm-link). To link the packages do the following:

1. Clone the [kendo-drawing](https://github.com/telerik/kendo-drawing) repo in the same parent directory, where `kendo-charts` is cloned.
2. Navigate to the `kendo-drawing` directory and execute `npm link`.
3. Build the package using `npm run build-package`.
5. Inside the `kendo-charts` directory run `npm i`, and then `npm link @progress/kendo-drawing`.

Now you should be able to make changes to `kendo-drawing` and seeing the effects in `kendo-charts`. After each change in `kendo-drawing` you should run `npm run build-package`.
